                 Already knew it, right?! Great, but maybe you do not know that: if you're looking for how to install the plugins or how to use them within your Wordpress installations, which is the right way to ask support?
                 That's the way:

                 * Register on http://yithemes.com
                 * Go to Support > Get Support

                 Here we provide support, not on wordpress.org were, usually we do not read topics. It's better to follow us or write on our forum!

                 == Installation ==

                 1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
                 2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
